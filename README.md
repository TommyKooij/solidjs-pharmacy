Pharmacy is a mock-website developed by me with SolidJS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Jest for testing. The site is meant to depict an online store where customers can buy pharmaceutical products, add them to their favorites list, or write reviews. Besides that, the user can also log in or register an account. Currently, most of these features are still incomplete, but I might finish them later if I get the chance to.

This site is mainly build for showcasing purposes, so some features might be incomplete or aren't added yet. Feel free to leave feedback.

To make sure the site is working properly, run the following commands:
- json-server -w -p 4000 ./db/product_data.json
- json-server -w -p 4001 ./db/review_data.json
